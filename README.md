# Hi-C-Trial
This is my first trial of using github and this repository are about to record the process of mining some interesting phenomenon form Hi-C data.For sure, some of related scripts i will share on there:) For contact ,please send e-mail to: yulong663@sjtu.edu.cn. Hope you guys could benefit from this repository :)

## Memo For Holiday:
1、Calculate that whether diffretiated expressed gene enriched on those four architecture switch regions( TAD boundaries,TAD,compartmenthairpin) and return the p-value.
2、Calculate whether the distribution between mono replicate1 and replicate2 are same or not.(KS test or Wilconx test)
3、Counts scatterplot for every regions of 3 pairs(mono->mono; mac->mac;native mono->mac)
